      "Arc works, Westinghouse etc. On returning back to Germany he joined Darmstadt T H University as a\n",
      "professor. Goldschmidt was a prolific inventor. His first patent was for a bicycle gear while still an\n",

      "early radio transmitter. The transmitter was used in the first trans‐Atlantic radiotelegraphic link\n",
      "between Germany and United States, opened on 19th June, 1914, with an exchange of telegrams\n",
      "between Kaiser Wilhelm II and President Woodrow Wilson.\n",
      "Figure 5: Einstein‐Goldschmidt design of a sound reproduction system.\n",
      "In 1922 Goldschmidt approached Einstein for his expert opinion regarding one of his patents.\n",
      "Thereafter, they kept in touch. Even after Einstein migrated to US and Goldschmidt to England, the\n",
      "friendship continued. On January 10, 1934 Goldschmidt and Einstein patented an “Electromagnetic\n",

      "Eisner, a distinguished singer, became hard on hearing, a serious drawback for a singer. In 1928,\n",
      "Einstein asked Goldschmidt’s assistance in developing a new type of hearing aid for her. At that time\n",
      "he sent his friend one of his poetic creations:\n",
      "Ein biszchen Technik dann und wann\n",
      "Auch Gruebler amusieren kann\n",
      "Drum kuehnlich denk ich schon so weit:\n",

      "One day we’ll produce something good together.\n",
      "Their collaboration resulted a design for sound reproduction system and a patent for the\n",
      "system. The schematic diagram of the device is shown in Figure 5. The final patent was entitled,\n",
      "“Device, especially for sound‐reproduction\n",
      "====================\n",
      "entitled,\n",
      "“Device, especially for sound‐reproduction equipment, in which changes of an electric current\n",
      "generate movements of a magnetised body by means of magnetostriction.” As the title suggests, they\n",
      "12used the physical phenomena of magnetostriction. What is magnetostriction? If a coil is wound round\n",
      "an iron magnet and a current is passed, the rod’s magnetism changes, so does the length. The change\n",
      "is small due to rod’s rigidity, which counters the magnetostriction. Einstein and Goldschmidt’s idea\n",
      "was to diminish the rigidity by keeping the rod under extreme pull to reduce it to a state of labile\n",
      "(where the external pull or pressure is close to its tear or buckling), such that the change in the length\n",
      "of the rod follows the changes in the electric current. When this arrangement is made in a microphone\n",
      "or loud speaker, lengthwise vibration of the rod follows the oscillation of the current in the coil\n",
      "produced by the sound to be transmitted.\n",
      "However, the original plan of development of a hearing aid did not materialize. They tried to\n",
      "invent an electro‐acoustical hearing aid. The basic idea was to convert the acoustical signal into\n",
      "electrical oscillation and transmit the signal by some sort of membrane attached to the skull such that\n",
      "the bone could conduct it to the hearing organ. They worked on the design but both had to flee\n",
      "Germany and their work was disrupted. Later, Goldschmidt tried to revive the idea, but Einstein was\n",
      "not interested. Furthermore, development of electronic hearing aid (where the audio signal is\n",
      "amplified many times) overshadowed their electro‐acoustical device.\n",
      "====================\n",
      "used to work upon on solving mathematical problems (not\n",
      "related to his ongoing theoretical investigations) or took upon some practical problem. As shown in\n",
      "Table. 2, Einstein was involved in three major inventions; (i) refrigeration system with Leo Szilard, (ii)\n",
      "Sound reproduction system with Rudolf Goldschmidt and (iii) automatic camera with Gustav Bucky.\n",
      "He also obtained a patent for a design of a blouse. It must also be mentioned that none of Einstein’s\n",

      "historical importance only. Below, his inventions are discussed in detail.\n",
      "====================\n",
      "Wein (1864‐1928) was a German physicist who did pioneering work on radiation. He\n",
      "discovered the displacement law (the wavelength changes with temperature). He also introduced the\n",
      "concept of ideal or black body (the body which completely absorbs all radiation). He also obtained the\n",
      "black body radiation law known as Wein's law, which later found to be valid only for short wavelength\n",
      "4Immediately after the 17th issue was published he came to Johann Laub8 and asked him to discuss\n",
      "Einstein’s papers in the next colloquium. Max Plank9 at Berlin also realized their importance. He was\n",

      "colloquium on relativity. The other man was the Polish professor Witkowski10, who after reading\n",
      "Einstein’s paper proclaimed to his colleagues, “A new Copernicus is born! Read Einstein’s paper.”\n",
      "Even though a few recognized his ability, he remained largely unknown to the academic world. For\n",
      "example, even in 1907 Max Born11 apparently was not aware of Einstein’s papers. In 1907, Einstein\n",
      "applied for a Privatdozentship at the University of Bern. Privatdozentship carried no salary, but only\n",
      "right to teach. However, it was denied due to a technical flaw in the application and only after Einstein\n",
      "corrected the technical flaw, he was granted Privatdozentship and formally, Einstein became a\n",
      "member of the academic world. In the meantime, he even contemplated for applying for a teacher’s\n",
      "position in a school. Gradually, his reputation as a mathematical physicist grew and he was offered his\n",
      "first faculty position, associate professor of the theoretical physics at the University of Zurich. Einstein\n",
      "left his job at the Patent office and joined the University of Zurich on October 15, 1909. Thereafter, he\n",
